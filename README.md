# SpacePathCalculator
A TypeScript project that determines the most optimal path for space travel between planets<br/>
This open source repo is a part of my bigger peoject I am planning to host on my website

## Important
Currently this project is not completed
## Build Dependencies
- browserify
- TypeScript
## How To Build
```
npm run build
```
The result will include all files, but the only usable one will be `index.js` in the `build/` folder<br/>
The rest of the files will only exist for debugging
