# SpacePathCalculator
One part of my bigger TS project

## Important
Currently this project is not completed, meaning its abosulutely useless. When its done, I will add more info.
## Build Dependencies
- browserify
- TypeScript
## How To Build
```
npm run build
```
The result will include all files, but the only usable one will be `index.js` in the `build/` folder<br/>
The rest of the files will only exist for debugging
